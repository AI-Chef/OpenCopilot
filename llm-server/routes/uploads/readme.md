**Testing Pre-signed Flow with `index.html` using `http-server`**
- Use `index.html` in combination with `http-server` for testing the pre-signed URL flow.

**Next Steps:**
1. Save File State in the Database.
2. Implement a Worker for File Processing.
3. Create a Cron Job for Handling Failed Jobs.

**Function Implementation:**
- Develop three functions for parsing:
    1. PDF parsing.
    2. Text parsing.
    3. Website parsing.
- Ensure that these functions can be executed from a new container for headless browsing.

**Check OCR Support in OpenChat:**
- Verify if OpenChat supports OCR functionality and integrate it into your application if needed.
