# Getting Started Guide: Debugging "opencopilot" with VS Code

Welcome to the world of local development and debugging for the "opencopilot" Flask application! This comprehensive guide will walk you through the setup process, leveraging the power of VS Code for a seamless debugging experience. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this debugging journey, ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Python extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

## Conda Installation

Refer to the [official Conda installation guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) suitable for your operating system. Once installed, validate your Conda setup by running `conda --version` in your terminal.

## Mypy Installation [Optional]

Enhance your development experience with Mypy (optional):

1. Activate your Conda environment.
2. Install Mypy: `pip install mypy`

## Copilot LLM Flask Application Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Begin by cloning the "opencopilot" Flask app repository to your local machine.

### Environmental Configuration

Create a file named `.env` at the root of the "llm_server" directory for environmental configuration:

**.env** (local development)

```ini
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR OPEN AI KEY>
PINECONE_API_KEY=<YOUR PINECONE KEY>
PINECONE_ENV=<YOUR PINECONE ENVIRONMENT>
MONGODB_URI=<MONGODB CONNECTION STRING>
QDRANT_SERVER_URI=<QDRANT SERVER URL>
QDRANT_API_KEY=<YOUR QDRANT API KEY>

# QDRANT_PASS must be set to the following key
QDRANT_PASS=bW9tZW50bmVhcmZld2VyYXJ0YmVuZG1pbGticmVhdGhldGFsZXN3aGFsZW5vYm9keXM=
ACTIONS_SCORE_THRESHOLD=0.5
FLOWS_SCORE_THRESHOLD=0.5
KB_SCORE_THRESHOLD=0.5
TARGET=development
```

Replace placeholders with the appropriate values.

### Project Dependencies

Install project dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Debugging Locally with VS Code

1. Enable debugging by selecting the 'Flask' debug configuration.
2. Press 'F5' to start debugging.

## Docker Debugging

Assuming you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, set `TARGET=development` in [Makefile].

1. Run `make install` or `make install-arm` based on the system architecture
2. Navigate to the "llm-server" directory.
3. Configure the 'Attach to flask in docker' option in VS Code and attach to the running container for debugging. The Flask process will not start until the debugger is attached.
   
Enjoy the magic of hot reloading during debugging sessions inside Docker containers. No need to restart the container after each code change.

Happy debugging! ðŸš€
