To integrate a third-party application (e.g., Trello) with the OpenCopilot's LLM server, users should create functions similar to the provided `process_state` function and store them in the specified directory. Here's a step-by-step guide on what users need to do:

1. **Access the Directory**:

   Users should navigate to the directory where the integration functions need to be stored. In this case, the directory path is:

   ```
   OpenCopilot/llm-server/integrations/
   ```

2. **Create a Python File**:

   Users should create a new Python file with a meaningful name that reflects the integration they are building. For example, if integrating with Trello, they can name it `trello.py`. This file will contain the integration functions.

3. **Write Integration Functions**:

   Inside the `trello.py` file, users should define functions similar to the `process_state` function provided in the example. These functions should perform the following tasks:

   - Interact with the third-party application's API to retrieve relevant data.
   - Transform the data to meet the specific requirements or format needed for the LLM or other applications.

   Users should ensure that their functions are organized, well-documented, and designed to provide context to the LLM server. The functions should return data in a structured format.

   For example, an integration function for Trello could retrieve data about Trello cards or members and transform it as required.

4. **Save the File**:

   Once the integration functions are defined, users should save the `trello.py` file in the specified directory.

5. **Usage in LLM Server**:
Usage is straightforward. You can invoke the integration functions within the LLM server by specifying the integration file's name when making calls to the server. The server will automatically detect and run the necessary functions, loading the data into memory. It will also periodically refresh the data to ensure it remains up-to-date and relevant.
