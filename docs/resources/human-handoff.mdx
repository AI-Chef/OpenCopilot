Currently, human handoff is in beta and only available for a few customers. If you are interested in using this feature, please contact us at mo@opencopilot.so, and we will be happy to help you.


## What is this?
One of the most important features of the Copilot is the ability to handoff the conversation to a human agent. This is useful when the Copilot is unable to understand the user's request or when the user requests to speak to a human agent, we reialzed that most of the time angry customers are looking for a human agent to talk to and solve their problems.


## How does it work?

Once this system action is installed on your copilot, a `handoff` event could happen in 2 ways:

- When the user explicitly asks to talk to a human agent.
- When the copilot is unable to understand the user's request or felt that the user is angry and dissatisfied.

## How to detect `handoff` event?

Once the copilot detects a `handoff` event, it will send a `{session_id}_handoff` socket event to the client with the following payload:

```json
{
  "summary": "Full summary of the conversation, to help the human agent understand the context of the conversation quickly.",
  "sentiment": "happy|neutral|angry"
}
```

Also, you can define a custom callback function to handle the `handoff` event on the client side. Here is an example of how to do that:

```javascript
```

In this callback, you can do whatever you want, like showing a button to the user to request a human agent, or send a notification to the human agent to take over the conversation, or transfer the conversation to a human agent automatically.
